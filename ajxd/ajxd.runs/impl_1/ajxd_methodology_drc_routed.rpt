2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell S_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) S_reg[0]_P/PRE, S_reg[1]_P/PRE, key_pulse_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell S_reg[1]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) S_reg[0]_C/CLR, S_reg[1]_C/CLR, S_reg[1]_LDC/CLR, key_pulse_reg_C/CLR, key_pulse_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin S_reg[0]_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin S_reg[0]_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin S_reg[1]_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin S_reg[1]_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin S_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin key_pulse_reg_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin key_pulse_reg_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch S_reg[1]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin S_reg[1]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch key_pulse_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin key_pulse_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
